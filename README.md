# RSSAgent IRC Logs Into Minutes in Markdown â€” Deno version

This is a copy of the [scribejs](https://github.com/w3c/scribejs) tools, developed for W3C usage, but adapted to Deno. The only role (for now) of this project is to explore the advantages and disadvantages of [deno](https://deno.land), compared to the more traditional Typescript+node.js approach.

For any further details about scribejs, see the relevant [github repo]((https://github.com/w3c/scribejs). There is no functional difference between the two, except for the fact that the Deno version is not prepared for running in a browser.
